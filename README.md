      The author of these books, J.K Rowling, has been in hot water as of late, following some previous statements about her political beliefs on both women and gender identity. If you do not wish to read or support her in any way then perhaps skip over this? If this either doesn't bother you or you want to just read the story then you are welcome to continue.

      This series was started in June of 2016 and ran all the way until June 4, 2023. The story follows a young boy in a world of magics, where every one would harness the "auras" around them to use certain abilities. A simple way to think of this as is a RPG of sorts. In order for the people of this world to harness the auras, they need either a large or deep enough soul. He was born as an "Unsouled", or some one with such a small soul, that it might as well not exist. This doesn't hinder him as we follow him as he meets new friends, makes new foes, and navigates this world with his wit and his resourcefulness to progress in the world, and possibly even out of it.

      A broken soldier, turned a slave. Forced to work on carrying bridges for a high prince. But perhaps he isn't as broken as he believes or at least he will have to. In the past the Knights Radiant stood against evil, but they have been gone for 2000 years. And now there is evil brewing and a plot is forming. An order is needed to save this Shattered Plane. Will he or others rise to the occasion, to harness the Storm? Or will they be torn down Odium and be consumed by hatred.

      The world of the Stormlight Archvie is a meticulously crafted world by Brandon Sanderson. A fleshed out world in the Cosmere universe, that has a system of power based on the mystical power of Stormlight. This power comes from the never ending, always moving storm that roams across the world of Roshar. Spirits, called Spren, embody the power of ideals and nature, and these are the key, the question is the key to what? If you want to find out, read them for yourself.
