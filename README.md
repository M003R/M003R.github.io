      The author of these books, J.K Rowling, has been in hot water as of late, following some previous statements about her political beliefs on both women and gender identity. If you do not wish to read or support her in any way then perhaps skip over this? If this either doesn't bother you or you want to just read the story then you are welcome to continue.

      This series was started in June of 2016 and ran all the way until June 4, 2023. The story follows a young boy in a world of magics, where every one would harness the "auras" around them to use certain abilities. A simple way to think of this as is a RPG of sorts. In order for the people of this world to harness the auras, they need a large or deep enough soul. He was born as an "Unsouled", or some one with such a small soul, that it might as well not exist. This doesn't hinder him as we follow him as he meets new friends, makes new foes, and navigates this world with his wit and his resourcefulness to progress in the world, and possibly even out of it.
